## [MNIST Classification](https://github.com/MarcoStallmann/Machine-Learning/tree/main/MNIST%20Classification)
In this Notebook we use the MNIST dataset, which is a Collection of 70,000 small pictures of handwritten digits and is often considered the "Hello world" of Machine Learning. We train a Stochastic Gradient descent (SDG) classifier on the dataset.
